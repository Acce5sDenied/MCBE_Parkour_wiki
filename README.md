A wiki for documenting minecraft bedrock movement mechanics.

#### TODO
+ block hitboxes
+ numbers
+ player control
+ bedrock mechanics
+ more

## Essentials
tick

## Player control
There are 2 major ways the player can move.
#### Button controls
WASD
#### Joystick controls
360
### Mouse movement
ok

## Hitboxes
List of collision and effect box for all blocks.

## Movement mechanics
+ xz collision order
+ no inertia i think
+ no bursting, shift glitch
+ use floats not double(i believe)

## Bedrock exclusive mechanics
Features exclusive to Bedrock edition of Minecraft that does not appear in Java.

## Numbers
I did not look at the codes, I got these by testing.
#### Airborne
+ horizontal drag: 0.91
+ walk acceleration: 0.0196
+ sprint acceleration:
+ gravity acceleration:
#### Flying
#### Normal block
+ horizontal drag: 0.546
+ shifted acceleration: 0.0294
+ walk acceleration: 0.098
+ sprint acceleration
+ sprint jump acceleration
+ jump vertical acceleration
#### Soulsand
#### Honey block
#### Slime block
#### Ices
#### Catch type blocks
#### Water
#### Lava

## Potion effects
